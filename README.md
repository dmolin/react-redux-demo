React-Redux demo application

No fancy UI at the moment (just a bare search box and a result list), since the focus is on the code structure and overall application architecture.

The project is setup with Webpack and a development server with Hotreload and feature a typical scenario, with a page allowing to search for data (fetched from the Just-Eat public API endpoints)
